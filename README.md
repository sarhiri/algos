# JavaScript Algorithms Practice Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my JavaScript Algorithms Practice Repository! This is where I'll be practicing JavaScript algorithms to prepare for technical interviews.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to help me sharpen my problem-solving skills and gain confidence in tackling algorithmic challenges commonly encountered in interviews.

## Getting Started
To get started:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Choose an algorithmic problem from the list.
3. Read the problem statement and understand the requirements.
4. Implement the solution on your own.
5. Compare your solution with the provided one and analyze the differences.
6. Repeat the process with other algorithmic problems to reinforce learning.

Happy coding!
